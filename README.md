aurora inverter monitor 

Aurora inverters are widely used to connect fv plants to the grid.
Curtis J. Blank @ Curtronics.com offers an open source (C based) program to probe this inverter. (http://www.curtronics.com/Solar/AuroraData.html#GetIt)

This project uses such software (compiled from source on Raspberry 3B) to setup a Python app to display aurora inverter data on the web. The Raspberry which run the app also hosts the web server (online @hserv.hopto.org).
