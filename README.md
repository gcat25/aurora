aurora inverter monitor 

Aurora inverters are widely used to connect fv plants to the grid.
Curtis J. Blank @ Curtronics.com offers an open source (C based) program to probe this inverter. (http://www.curtronics.com/Solar/AuroraData.html#GetIt)

This project uses such software to setup a Python app to display aurora inverter data on the web, using a Raspberry 3B unit.
